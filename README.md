# Personal-Website
This is a website version of my CV.

It runs on Xampp's Infrastructure and uses a number of bootstrap google and other css packages.

Placing the "My Website" Folder under htdocs folder in xampp should be enough to run the project.



                      DESIGN CHOICES
 I've included a number of animations to have an engaging website. Ive also included interactive images to include the hobbies in an interesting and engaging way.
 
                      CHALLANGES
1.) Using google bots in the website to use for a more dynamic website.
2.) Carousel could not display pictures of projects under skill section the way it was determined.
3.) Arrangement of Divs in a vertical order to list Items in sequence.
4.) Including animated image from Genially.
